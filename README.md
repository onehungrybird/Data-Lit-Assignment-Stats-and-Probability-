Assignment instructions:  
   Use Google Co-lab (or Jupyter) 
   Save your workbook to a Github repository 
   The first person to solve this and post their repo in the comments below will get a huge shout-out! 
   
   Part 1:  
   Follow the “Histograms and Density Plots in Python” tutorial to figure out which airline is most likely to get you to your destination    on time. 
   Download the data file (formatted_flights.csv) here 
   Tell us which airline you choose and why. 
   
   Part 2:  
   Use the same airline data to demonstrate (or disprove) the four aspects of the Central Limit Theorem (from Central Limit Theorem video) 
   Hint: take repeated random samples of a specific size and measure the mean and standard deviation of each one. 
   Graph your results. 
   Does it look like a normal distribution? 
   How does sample size affect your results?
